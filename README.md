# PolarizationModel

The models used in this program have been taken from: "Opinion Dynamics and
Bounded Confidence Models, Analysis, and Simulation" by Rainer Hegselmann 
and Ulrich Krause (2002).

In this program we aim to simulate different models of opinion formation 
within an interacting population.
